      "A Dietitian is a health professional who has a Bachelor's degree or a Masters degree specialising in food and nutrition, as well as a period of practical training in a hospital and a community setting. It takes at least four years of full-time study at a university to qualify as a Dietitian at an undergraduate level. There are also now a number of fulltime Masters programmes (2 yrs) which allow those with a suitable primary degree to qualify as a Dietitian. Many Dietitians go on to further their knowledge by pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree. Dietitians apply the science of nutrition to promote health, treat and prevent malnutrition and provide therapeutic dietary guidelines for patients, clients and the public in health and illness.\n",
